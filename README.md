# Good Web Search

*Search the good web again.*

Good Web Search is an extension for Firefox and Chromium-based browsers that automatically adjusts search parameters to surface more useful results and makes search engines behave more like they used to in the "good ol' days" of the web by reducing AI-generated clutter and enabling hidden search options. 

## Details

### Web Search Mode

For Google searches, Good Web Search can enable "web" search mode, removing most of the clutter and distractions found in the default view.

### Before 2023

Appends `before:2023` to search queries, surfacing good results that recently are often flooded beneath an ocean of AI slop.

### No AI

Appends `-ai` to search queries, further holding back the dilugue. In the case of DuckDuckGo searches, it instead redirects to `noai.duckduckgo.com`.

### Search Engine Support

Good Web Search is currently (2026-06-22) tested and working with:

- Google (all features)
- [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/) (before 2023, no ai)
- [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) (no ai)
- Brave (no ai)
- Bing (no ai)
